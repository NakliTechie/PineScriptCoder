# Project Checkpoint System

This directory contains checkpoint files for tracking progress and enabling resume capability in Pine Script development projects.

## Purpose
- Track progress of ongoing development tasks
- Enable resumption after interruptions (quota limits, outages, etc.)
- Maintain state of partially completed work
- Document completed subtasks and next steps

## Checkpoint Structure
Each checkpoint file contains:
1. **Timestamp**: When the checkpoint was created
2. **Project Status**: Current state of the project
3. **Completed Tasks**: List of completed subtasks
4. **Pending Tasks**: List of remaining tasks
5. **Current Focus**: What was being worked on when checkpoint was saved
6. **Next Steps**: Planned immediate next actions
7. **Progress Metrics**: Quantitative measures of completion

## Usage Instructions

### Creating Checkpoints
1. **After Each Subtask Completion**: Save checkpoint when finishing any significant subtask
2. **Before Interruptions**: Save checkpoint before stopping work or when quota nears limit
3. **At Natural Breaks**: Save checkpoint at logical stopping points in development flow

### Resuming Work
1. **Review Last Checkpoint**: Load most recent checkpoint file
2. **Assess Current State**: Understand what was completed and what remains
3. **Continue from Last Focus**: Resume work on the "Current Focus" item
4. **Update Progress**: Create new checkpoint after completing next subtask

## File Naming Convention
`checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Timestamped JSON checkpoint files
`latest_checkpoint.json` - Symlink to most recent checkpoint

## Checkpoint Fields

### Metadata
- `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp of checkpoint creation
- `project_name`: Name of the project being worked on
- `session_id`: Unique identifier for current development session

### Status Tracking
- `overall_progress`: Percentage completion of project (0-100)
- `completed_tasks`: Array of completed task descriptions
- `pending_tasks`: Array of remaining task descriptions
- `milestones_reached`: Array of major milestones achieved

### Work Context
- `current_focus`: Description of what was being worked on
- `current_file`: Path to file being actively modified
- `current_section`: Specific section or function being developed
- `next_steps`: Immediate planned actions (1-3 items)

### Progress Metrics
- `lines_of_code`: Approximate lines of functional code
- `functions_implemented`: Number of completed functions
- `features_completed`: Number of completed features
- `testing_status`: Current state of testing/validation

### Recovery Information
- `resume_instructions`: Specific steps to continue work
- `dependencies_resolved`: Boolean indicating if external dependencies are ready
- `known_issues`: Any problems that need addressing
- `blocking_factors`: Anything preventing progress
