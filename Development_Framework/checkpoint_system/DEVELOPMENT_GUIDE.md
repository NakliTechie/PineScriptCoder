# Pine Script Development Checkpoint System

This system provides automatic progress tracking and resume capability for Pine Script development projects, ensuring work can be continued seamlessly after interruptions.

## System Overview

### Purpose
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatically track completion of development tasks
- **Resume Capability**: Enable seamless continuation after interruptions
- **State Preservation**: Maintain context of ongoing work
- **Workflow Documentation**: Record completed tasks and next steps

### Key Components
1. **Checkpoint Manager**: Python script for creating and managing checkpoints
2. **Checkpoint Files**: JSON files storing project state and progress
3. **Template System**: Standardized checkpoint structure
4. **Integration Hooks**: Easy integration into development workflows

## Checkpoint Structure

### Metadata
- `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp of checkpoint creation
- `project_name`: Name of the project being worked on
- `session_id`: Unique identifier for current development session

### Progress Tracking
- `overall_progress`: Percentage completion of project (0-100)
- `completed_tasks`: Array of completed task descriptions
- `pending_tasks`: Array of remaining task descriptions
- `milestones_reached`: Array of major milestones achieved

### Work Context
- `current_focus`: Description of what was being worked on
- `current_file`: Path to file being actively modified
- `current_section`: Specific section or function being developed
- `next_steps`: Immediate planned actions (1-3 items)

### Metrics & Status
- `lines_of_code`: Approximate lines of functional code
- `functions_implemented`: Number of completed functions
- `features_completed`: Number of completed features
- `testing_status`: Current state of testing/validation

### Recovery Information
- `resume_instructions`: Specific steps to continue work
- `dependencies_resolved`: Boolean indicating if external dependencies are ready
- `known_issues`: Any problems that need addressing
- `blocking_factors`: Anything preventing progress

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Project Initialization
```python
from checkpoint_manager import CheckpointManager

# Initialize checkpoint for new project
cm = CheckpointManager()
checkpoint_file = cm.create_checkpoint(
    project_name="My Screener",
    session_id="screener_development_001",
    overall_progress=0,
    completed_tasks=[],
    pending_tasks=["Create template", "Define inputs", "Implement logic"],
    current_focus="Initialize project structure",
    current_file="screeners/my_screener/wip/my_screener.pine"
)
```

### 2. During Development
After completing each significant subtask:
```python
# Update checkpoint when completing tasks
latest = cm.get_latest_checkpoint()
latest["completed_tasks"].append("Implemented RSI calculation")
latest["overall_progress"] = 35
# ... update other fields as needed
# Save updated checkpoint
```

### 3. Before Interruptions
```python
# Create checkpoint before stopping work
cm.create_checkpoint(
    project_name="My Screener",
    overall_progress=45,
    current_focus="Testing with different timeframes",
    next_steps=["Fix divergence issues", "Optimize performance"],
    resume_instructions=[
        "Open my_screener.pine in TradingView",
        "Test with BTCUSD, ETHUSD, and AAPL",
        "Review signal accuracy in volatile markets"
    ]
)
```

### 4. Resuming Work
```python
# Resume from latest checkpoint
latest = cm.get_latest_checkpoint()
print(f"Resuming {latest['project_name']}")
print(f"Progress: {latest['overall_progress']}%")
print(f"Next steps: {latest['next_steps']}")
```

## Integration Guidelines

### Automatic Checkpoint Creation
1. **After Template Creation**: When initial file structure is ready
2. **After Function Implementation**: When core functions are completed
3. **After Testing Milestones**: When passing initial validation tests
4. **Before Complex Tasks**: Before implementing complex logic
5. **At Natural Breaks**: At logical stopping points in development

### Manual Checkpoint Triggers
1. **Before Leaving Work**: End of development session
2. **Before Quota Limits**: When approaching usage limits
3. **After Major Breakthroughs**: Significant progress milestones
4. **Before Risky Changes**: Major refactoring or experimental features

## File Management

### Directory Structure
```
checkpoints/
├── checkpoint_20250824_153045.json  # Timestamped checkpoint
├── checkpoint_20250824_164522.json  # Another checkpoint
├── latest_checkpoint.json         # Symlink to most recent
├── template_checkpoint.json       # Template for new checkpoints
└── README.md                      # Documentation
```

### Naming Convention
- **Format**: `checkpoint_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`
- **Timestamp**: Creation time in UTC
- **Latest Link**: `latest_checkpoint.json` symlink to newest

## Best Practices

### Consistent Updates
- **Regular Intervals**: Create checkpoints at consistent intervals
- **Task Completion**: Always checkpoint after completing significant tasks
- **Progress Updates**: Incrementally update progress percentages
- **Context Preservation**: Always record current focus and next steps

### Meaningful Descriptions
- **Clear Task Names**: Use specific, actionable task descriptions
- **Detailed Focus Areas**: Describe exactly what was being worked on
- **Concrete Next Steps**: List specific, achievable next actions
- **Helpful Resume Notes**: Include enough context to resume quickly

### Recovery Planning
- **Explicit Instructions**: Provide step-by-step resume instructions
- **File Locations**: Always specify exact file paths
- **Dependencies**: Note any required external resources
- **Blocking Issues**: Document anything preventing progress

## Integration Examples

### Screener Development Integration
```python
# In screener development workflow
def develop_screener(name):
    # Initialize
    cm.create_checkpoint(
        project_name=name,
        current_focus="Creating screener template",
        pending_tasks=["Template creation", "Input definition", "Logic implementation"],
        resume_instructions=[f"Navigate to screeners/{name}/wip/", f"Open {name}.pine"]
    )
    
    # After template creation
    cm.create_checkpoint(
        project_name=name,
        overall_progress=15,
        completed_tasks=["Created basic template structure"],
        current_focus="Defining input parameters",
        next_steps=["Add RSI length parameter", "Add threshold parameters"]
    )
```

### Multi-Instance Deployment Integration
```python
# In multi-instance deployment workflow
def deploy_instances(name, total_instances=10):
    for i in range(1, total_instances + 1):
        cm.create_checkpoint(
            project_name=f"{name} - Instance {i}",
            overall_progress=(i/total_instances)*100,
            completed_tasks=[f"Deployed instances 1 through {i}"],
            current_focus=f"Deploying instance {i+1}",
            next_steps=[f"Configure instance {i+1} parameters", f"Test instance {i+1}"],
            current_file=f"screeners/{name}/final/{name}_{i}.pine"
        )
```

## Recovery Procedures

### After Interruption
1. **Load Latest Checkpoint**: Use `get_latest_checkpoint()`
2. **Review Current State**: Check `current_focus` and `progress`
3. **Follow Resume Instructions**: Execute steps in `resume_instructions`
4. **Continue Next Steps**: Work on items in `next_steps`

### After Extended Break
1. **Review Recent Checkpoints**: Check progress over last few sessions
2. **Validate Current Work**: Ensure files are in expected state
3. **Update Dependencies**: Refresh any external resources
4. **Adjust Plans**: Modify `pending_tasks` based on new priorities

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- **Archive Old Checkpoints**: Move completed project checkpoints to archive
- **Update Templates**: Keep checkpoint template current with new fields
- **Review Processes**: Periodically assess checkpoint effectiveness

### Backup Strategy
- **Version Control**: Include checkpoints in project repository
- **Cloud Storage**: Sync to cloud storage for redundancy
- **Automated Backups**: Schedule regular backup of checkpoint directory
